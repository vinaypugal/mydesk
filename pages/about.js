                  We are a team of zealous mentors thriving to make online
                  classes a bit more interesting and comfortable for the
                  students. We are trying to connect the tutors and students in
                  an easier way with the help of this platform. In this way,
                  both the students and tutors are mutually benefited. Also we
                  are responsible to explain how this platform works for the
                  students and the tutors.

                  <li>
                    <i className="bi bi-check-circle" /> The students have to
                    register themselves <a href="register_student.html" /> first
                    by providing the necessary information.

                    required subject which will be continued for a week.

                    either private or regular classes.
